# markov-haiku

Mostly for fun. Old code which is not very pretty, but still works. The program creates a 3 word markov chain based on source material
(in this case Ulysses) and generates a haiku from it. Play around with it and have fun. Beautiful Soup or another parser may be needed for 
webpages which aren't just text files.
